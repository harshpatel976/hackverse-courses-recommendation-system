This tutorial is designed for beginners who have no Idea of JavaScript. It is a step by step tutorial which will include 5-6 Projects with Game development.\n\nJavaScript (JS) is a lightweight, interpreted, or just-in-time compiled programming language with first-class functions. While it is most well-known as the scripting language for Web pages, many non-browser environments also use it, such as Node.js, Apache CouchDB and Adobe Acrobat. JavaScript is a prototype-based, multi-paradigm, single-threaded, dynamic language, supporting object-oriented, imperative, and declarative (e.g. functional programming) styles.\n\nIn this Video Tutorial series I will giving you full training about Java script from basic to advance level with easy and best explanation.

Neither the length of a JavaScript array nor the types of its elements are fixed. Since an array's length can change at any time, and data can be stored at non-contiguous locations in the array, JavaScript arrays are not guaranteed to be dense; this depends on how the programmer chooses to use them. In general, these are convenient characteristics; but if these features are not desirable for your particular use, you might consider using typed arrays.\n\nArrays cannot use strings as element indexes (as in an associative array) but must use integers. Setting or accessing via non-integers using bracket notation (or dot notation) will not set or retrieve an element from the array list itself, but will set or access a variable associated with that array's object property collection. The array's object properties and list of array elements are separate, and the array's traversal and mutation operations cannot be applied to these named properties.\n\n\n\nIn this Video Tutorial series I will giving you full training about Javascript from basic to advance level with easy and best explanation.

You can refer to a function's arguments inside that function by using its arguments object. It has entries for each argument the function was called with, with the first entry's index at 0.\n\nYou can use arguments.length to count how many arguments the function was called with. If you instead want to count how many parameters a function is declared to accept, inspect that function's length property.\n\n\n\nIn this Video Tutorial series I will giving you full training about Javascript from basic to advance level with easy and best explanation.

Functions are said to be a collection of statements to be executed in a proper sequence in a particular context. Now JavaScript provides a variety of methods to define and execute Functions, there are named functions, anonymous functions and then there are Functions that are executed as soon as they are mounted, these functions are known as Immediately Invoked Function Expressions or IIFEs. Let us dive deeper to know more about IIFEs.\n\nAn IIFE (Immediately Invoked Function Expression) is a JavaScript function that runs as soon as it is defined.\n\n\nPlease subscribe to watch more videos like this: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCWCGvAu1NDCldmLasELk62g?sub_confirmation=1\n\n\n\nJoin this channel to support Tech Gun:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCWCGvAu1NDCldmLasELk62g/join",

An object is a collection of properties, and a property is an association between a name (or key) and a value. A property's value can be a function, in which case the property is known as a method. In addition to objects that are predefined in the browser, you can define your own objects. This videos describes how to use objects, properties, functions, and methods, and how to create your own objects.\n\n\nPlease subscribe to watch more videos like this: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCWCGvAu1NDCldmLasELk62g?sub_confirmation=1\n\n\n\nJoin this channel to support Tech Gun:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCWCGvAu1NDCldmLasELk62g/join",

A property of an object can be explained as a variable that is attached to the object. Object properties are basically the same as ordinary JavaScript variables, except for the attachment to objects. The properties of an object define the characteristics of the object. You access the properties of an object with a simple dot-notation:\n\nSyntax: objectName.propertyName\n\nPlease subscribe to watch more videos like this: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCWCGvAu1NDCldmLasELk62g?sub_confirmation=1",

It also has some differences between strict mode and non-strict mode.\n\nIn most cases, the value of this is determined by how a function is called (runtime binding). It can't be set by assignment during execution, and it may be different each time the function is called. ES5 introduced the bind() method to set the value of a function's this regardless of how it's called, and ES2015 introduced arrow functions which don't provide their own this binding (it retains the this value of the enclosing lexical context).\n\nThe JavaScript this keyword refers to the object it belongs to.\n\nIt has different values depending on where it is used:\n\n    In a method, this refers to the owner object.\n    Alone, this refers to the global object.\n    In a function, this refers to the global object.\n    In a function, in strict mode, this is undefined.\n    In an event, this refers to the element that received the event.\n    Methods like call(), and apply() can refer this to any object.\n\n\n\nJoin this channel to support Tech Gun:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCWCGvAu1NDCldmLasELk62g/join",

This date and time are not the same as the UNIX epoch (the number of seconds that have elapsed since midnight on January 1, 1970, UTC), which is the predominant base value for computer-recorded date and time values.\n\nPlease subscribe to watch more videos like this: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCWCGvAu1NDCldmLasELk62g?sub_confirmation=1\n\n\n\nJoin this channel to support Tech Gun:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCWCGvAu1NDCldmLasELk62g/join",

Creates a blank, plain JavaScript object.\n2. Adds a property to the new object (__proto__) that links to the constructor function's prototype object\n3. Properties/objects added to the construction function prototype are therefore accessible to all instances created from the constructor function (using new).\n4. Binds the newly created object instance as the this context (i.e. all references to this in the constructor function now refer to the object created in the first step).\n5. Returns this if the function doesn't return an object.\n\n\nPlease subscribe to watch more videos like this: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCWCGvAu1NDCldmLasELk62g?sub_confirmation=1\n\n\n\n\n\nJoin this channel to support Tech Gun:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCWCGvAu1NDCldmLasELk62g/join",

In an object literal they are denoted by get and set\n\nSometimes it is desirable to allow access to a property that returns a dynamically computed value, or you may want to reflect the status of an internal variable without requiring the use of explicit method calls. In JavaScript, this can be accomplished with the use of a getter.\n\nIt is not possible to simultaneously have a getter bound to a property and have that property actually hold a value, although it is possible to use a getter and a setter in conjunction to create a type of pseudo-property.\n\n\nIn JavaScript, a setter can be used to execute a function whenever a specified property is attempted to be changed. Setters are most often used in conjunction with getters to create a type of pseudo-property. It is not possible to simultaneously have a setter on a property that holds an actual value.\n\nWhy Using Getters and Setters?\n1. It gives simpler syntax\n2. It allows equal syntax for properties and methods\n3. It can secure better data quality\n4. It is useful for doing things behind-the-scenes\n\n\nPlease subscribe to watch more videos like this: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCWCGvAu1NDCldmLasELk62g?sub_confirmation=1\n\n\n\nJoin this channel to support Tech Gun:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCWCGvAu1NDCldmLasELk62g/join",

The way to create an \"object type\", is to use an object constructor function.\n\nObjects of the same type are created by calling the constructor function with the new keyword.\n\nIn JavaScript, the thing called this is the object that \"owns\" the code. The value of this , when used in an object, is the object itself. In a constructor function this does not have a value. It is a substitute for the new object.\n\nNote: It is considered a good practice to capitalize the first letter of your constructor function.\n\nThe constructor property returns a reference to the Object constructor function that created the instance object. Note that the value of this property is a reference to the function itself, not a string containing the function's name.\n\n\nPlease subscribe to watch more videos like this: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCWCGvAu1NDCldmLasELk62g?sub_confirmation=1\n\n\n\nJoin this channel to support Tech Gun:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCWCGvAu1NDCldmLasELk62g/join",

In this video, i will explain how prototype chains work and look at how the prototype property can be used to add methods to existing constructors.\n\nAll JavaScript objects inherit properties and methods from a prototype.\n\nThe prototype object is special type of enumerable object to which additional properties can be attached to it which will be shared across all the instances of it's constructor function.\n\nEvery object which is created using literal syntax or constructor syntax with the new keyword, includes __proto__ property that points to prototype object of a function that created this object.\n\nJavaScript is often described as a prototype-based language ‚Äî to provide inheritance, objects can have a prototype object, which acts as a template object that it inherits methods and properties from.\n\n\n\nPlease subscribe to watch more videos like this: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCWCGvAu1NDCldmLasELk62g?sub_confirmation=1\n\n\n\nJoin this channel to support Tech Gun:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCWCGvAu1NDCldmLasELk62g/join",

Hoisting was thought up as a general way of thinking about how execution contexts (specifically the creation and execution phases) work in JavaScript. However, the concept can be a little confusing at first.\n\n\nPlease subscribe to watch more videos like this: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCWCGvAu1NDCldmLasELk62g?sub_confirmation=1\n\n\n\nJoin this channel to support Tech Gun:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCWCGvAu1NDCldmLasELk62g/join",

It represents the page so that programs can change the document structure, style, and content. The DOM represents the document as nodes and objects. That way, programming languages can connect to the page.\n\nA Web page is a document. This document can be either displayed in the browser window or as the HTML source. But it is the same document in both cases. The Document Object Model (DOM) represents that same document so it can be manipulated. The DOM is an object-oriented representation of the web page, which can be modified with a scripting language such as JavaScript.\n\n\nWith the object model, JavaScript gets all the power it needs to create dynamic HTML:\n\nJavaScript can change all the HTML elements in the page\nJavaScript can change all the HTML attributes in the page\nJavaScript can change all the CSS styles in the page\nJavaScript can remove existing HTML elements and attributes\nJavaScript can add new HTML elements and attributes\nJavaScript can react to all existing HTML events in the page\nJavaScript can create new HTML events in the page\n\nNote: In the DOM, all HTML elements are defined as objects. so it will have both property and method\n\nThe document object represents your web page.\nIf you want to access any element in an HTML page, you always start with accessing the document object.\n\n\n\nPlease subscribe to watch more videos like this: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCWCGvAu1NDCldmLasELk62g?sub_confirmation=1\n\n\n\n\nJoin this channel to support Tech Gun:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCWCGvAu1NDCldmLasELk62g/join",

The return collection is a NodeList.\n\nOnce you selected an element, you can add styles to the element, manipulate its attributes, and traversing to parent and child elements.\n\nSince the getElementsByClassName() is a method of the Element, you can select elements with a given class inside a container.\n\nThe HTMLCollection object represents a collection of nodes. The nodes can be accessed by index numbers. The index starts at 0.\n\nTip: You can use the length property of the HTMLCollection object to determine the number of elements with a specified class name, then you can loop through all elements and extract the info you want.\n\n\n\nPlease subscribe to watch more videos like this: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCWCGvAu1NDCldmLasELk62g?sub_confirmation=1\n\n\n\nJoin this channel to support Tech Gun:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCWCGvAu1NDCldmLasELk62g/join",

We know that the DOM is structured as a tree of nodes with the document node at the root and every other node (including elements, comments, and text nodes) as the various branches.\n\nOften, you will want to move through the DOM without specifying each and every element beforehand. Learning how to navigate up and down the DOM tree and move from branch to branch is essential to understanding how to work with JavaScript and HTML.\n\nWith the HTML DOM, you can navigate the node tree using node relationships.\n\nYou can use the following node properties to navigate between nodes with JavaScript:\n\n    parentElement\n    firstElementChild\n    lastElementChild\n    children\n    nextElementSibling\n    previousElementSibling\n\n\nPlease subscribe to watch more videos like this: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCWCGvAu1NDCldmLasELk62g?sub_confirmation=1\n\n\n\nJoin this channel to support Tech Gun:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCWCGvAu1NDCldmLasELk62g/join",

If the given child is a reference to an existing node in the document, appendChild() moves it from its current position to the new position (there is no requirement to remove the node from its parent node before appending it to some other node).\n\nThis means that a node can't be in two points of the document simultaneously. So if the node already has a parent, the node is first removed, then appended at the new position. The Node.cloneNode() method can be used to make a copy of the node before appending it under the new parent. Note that the copies made with cloneNode will not be automatically kept in sync.\n\nIf the given child is a DocumentFragment, the entire contents of the DocumentFragment are moved into the child list of the specified parent node.\n\nPlease subscribe to watch more videos like this: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCWCGvAu1NDCldmLasELk62g?sub_confirmation=1\n\n\n\nJoin this channel to support Tech Gun:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCWCGvAu1NDCldmLasELk62g/join",
